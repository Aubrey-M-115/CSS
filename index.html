<p>Hi! I am Aubrey Moote</p>
<p> I am majoring in software engineering with a minor in small business management</p>
<p> I am the youngest of 5, and I have learned a lot from their experiences through life.</p>
<p> I love reading; especially with music to guide me. Music helps me to envelop myself in the story and feel as the
    characters would.</p>
<p> Some of my hobbies are playing volleyball, playing board games with my roommates, and participating in Smash Bros.
    Ultimate tournaments.</p>
